In all 300 billion words were fed into the system.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe end result is a Chatbot that can seem eerily human, but with an encyclopedic knowledge.\r\n<p></p>\r\nTell ChatGPT what you have in your kitchen cabinet and it will give you a recipe. Need a snappy intro to a big presentation? No problem.\r\n<p></p>\r\nBut is it too good? Its convincing approximation of human responses could be a powerful tool for those up to no good.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAcademics, cybersecurity researchers and AI experts warn that ChatGPT could be used by bad actors to sow dissent and spread propaganda on social media.\r\n<p></p>\r\nUntil now, spreading misinformation required considerable human labour. But an AI like ChatGPT would make it much easier for so-called troll armies to scale up their operations, according to a report from Georgetown University, Stanford Internet Observatory and OpenAI, published in January.\r\n<p></p>\r\nSophisticated language processing systems like ChatGPT could impact so-called influence operations on social media.\r\n<p></p>\r\nSuch campaigns seek to deflect criticism and cast a ruling government party or politician in a positive manner, and they can also advocate for or against policies. Using fake accounts they also spread misinformation on social media.One such campaign was launched in the run-up to the 2016 US election.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThousands of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts created by the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency focused on harming Hillary Clinton\'s campaign and supporting Donald Trump, concluded the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2019.\r\n<p></p>\r\nBut future elections may have to deal with an even great deluge of misinformation.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"The potential of language models to rival human-written content at low cost suggests that these models, like any powerful technology, may provide distinct advantages to propagandists who choose to use them,\" the AI report released in January says.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"These advantages could expand access to a greater number of actors, enable new tactics of influence, and make a campaign\'s messaging far more tailored and potentially effective,\" the report warns.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIt\'s not only the quantity of misinformation that could go up, it\'s also the quality.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAI systems could improve the persuasive quality of content and make those messages difficult for ordinary Internet users to recognise as part of co-ordinated disinformation campaigns, says Josh Goldstein, a co-author of the paper and a research fellow at Georgetown\'s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, where he works on the CyberAI Project.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"Generative language models could produce a high volume of content that is original each time... and allow each propagandist to not rely on copying and pasting the same text across social media accounts or news sites,\" he says.Mr Goldstein goes on to say that if a platform is flooded with untrue information or propaganda, it will make it more difficult for the public to discern what is true. Often, that can be the aim of those bad actors taking part in influence operations.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHis report also notes how access to these systems may not remain the domain of a few organisations.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"Right now, a small number of firms or governments possess top-tier language models, which are limited in the tasks they can perform reliably and in the languages they output.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"If more actors invest in state-of-the-art generative models, then this could increase the odds that propagandists gain access to them,\" his report says.\r\n<p></p>\r\nNefarious groups could view AI-written content similar to spam, says Gary Marcus, an AI specialist and founder of Geometric Intelligence, an AI company acquired by Uber in 2016.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"People who spread spam around rely on the most gullible people to click on their links, using that spray and pray approach of reaching as many people as possible. But with AI, that squirt gun can become the biggest Super Soaker of all time.\"\r\n<p></p>\r\nIn addition, even if platforms such as Twitter and Facebook take down three-quarters of what those perpetrators spread on their networks, \"there is still at least 10 times as much content as before that can still aim to mislead people online\", Mr Marcus says.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe surge of fake social media accounts became a thorn in the sides of Twitter and Facebook, and the quick maturation of language model systems today will only crowd those platforms with even more phony profiles.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"Something like ChatGPT can scale that spread of fake accounts on a level we haven\'t seen before,\" says Vincent Conitzer, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, \"and it can become harder to distinguish each of those accounts from human beings.', 'Both the January 2023 paper co-authored by Mr Goldstein and a similar report from security firm WithSecure Intelligence, warn of how generative language models can quickly and efficiently create fake news articles that could be spread across social media, further adding to the deluge of false narratives that could impact voters before a decisive election.\r\n\r\nBut if misinformation and fake news emerge as an even bigger threat because of AI systems like Chat-GPT, should social media platforms be as proactive as possible? Some experts think they\'ll be lax to enforce any of those kinds of posts.', '2023-02-14', '18:00:00', 'UK', '\\images\\Technology\\tech01.jpg', 1),

At one point, it\'s reported that 1.3 million people were watching content related to the game on Twitch.\r\n<p></p>\r\nSome have pushed back against the boycott, arguing that choosing to play the game doesn\'t automatically mean they support the author\'s statements.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe title sees players attend the school made famous by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - but before their time, back in the 1800s.\r\n<p></p>\r\nYou can zoom around on a broomstick, learn to cast spells, explore the castle, fight giant spiders and collect a variety of hats and scarves to wear as you go.Critical reaction to the game itself has been largely positive, with review aggregator Metacritic scoring the PlayStation 5 version at 86%.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe Guardian\'s games editor Keza MacDonald wasn\'t as enthusiastic as some, writing: \"Hogwarts Legacy derives its magic from its setting, not from its game design, which is competent but unspectacular.\"\r\n<p></p>\r\nShe said the game feels too familiar to others in the genre to really stand out, but concluded that its \"magical moments and the setting rescue it from mediocrity, but only if the Wizarding World still has you under its spell\".\r\n<p></p>\r\nTravis Northup, reviewing for IGN, wrote: \"Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours.\"\r\n<p></p>\r\nHe scored it nine out of 10 but did comment on some technical issues, a lacklustre main story and some poor enemy variety as drawbacks.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHaving spent roughly a third of the estimated 35 hours it would take to finish the main game playing myself, I think the attention to detail is impressive and it comes into its own as a simulation of life in Hogwarts - but elements of the gameplay are a little repetitive.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIt\'s clear that the developers have made a significant attempt to modernise the setting. The character customisation options are thorough for all ethnic backgrounds, there is global representation in the non-playable-characters, as well as gay and trans representation.That effort has not won over some gamers, who see it as too close to the wizarding world\'s divisive creator.\r\n<p></p>\r\nRowling herself has previously suggested her income is a sign that her opinions don\'t alienate audiences.\r\n<p></p>\r\nShe has spoken against the erasure of women and allowing transgender people access to single-sex spaces.

However, she has said she supports trans rights and wants trans people to be free from discrimination and abuse.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIn 2020, she said: \"My life has been shaped by being female.

In 1966, TV show Tomorrow\'s World reported on a household robot which could cook dinner, walk the dog, mind the baby, do the shopping, mix a cocktail and many other tasks.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIf its creators were only given £1m the device could be working by 1976, ran the news story...Ekaterina Hertog, associate professor in AI and Society at Oxford University and one of the study authors draws parallels with the optimism which has long surrounded self-driving cars: \"The promise of self-driving cars, being on the streets, replacing taxis, has been there, I think, for decades now - and yet, we haven\'t been able quite to make robots function well, or these self-driving cars navigate the unpredictable environment of our streets. Homes are similar in that sense\".\r\n<p></p>\r\nDr Kate Devlin, reader in AI and Society at King\'s College, London - who was not involved in the study - suggests technology is more likely to help humans, rather than replace them: \"It\'s difficult and expensive to make a robot that can do multiple or general tasks. Instead, it\'s easier and more useful to create assistive technology that helps us rather than replaces us,\" she said.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe research suggests domestic automation could free up a lot of time spent on unpaid domestic work. In the UK, working age men do around half as much of this unpaid work as working age women, in Japan the men do less than a fifth.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe disproportionate burden of household work on women has a negative affect on women\'s earnings, savings and pensions, Prof Hertog argues. Increasing automation could therefore result in greater gender equality, the researchers say.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHowever, technology can be expensive. If systems to assist with housework are only affordable to a subset of society \"that is going to lead to a rise of inequality in free time\" Prof Hertog said.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAnd she said society needed to be alive to the issues raised by homes full of smart automation, \"where an equivalent of Alexa is able to listen in and sort of record what we\'re doing and report back\".\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"I don\'t think that we as a society are prepared to manage that wholesale onslaught on privacy\".\r\n', 'Researchers from the UK and Japan asked 65 artificial intelligence (AI) experts to predict the amount of automation in common household tasks in 10 years.\r\n\r\nExperts predicted grocery shopping was likely to see the most automation, while caring for the young or old was the least likely to be impacted by AI.', '2023-02-22', '12:00:00', 'UK', '\\images\\Technology\\tech02.jpg', 1),

Is this what all gaming will look like in future?\r\n<p></p>\r\nGames journalist Jordan Middler from Videogames Chronicle (VGC) spent time with the device ahead of its release.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHe says he\'s always wanted a better experience from VR than its been able to provide.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"From a hardware perspective it\'s incredible, a really impressive headset,\" he begins.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"The price (£529) might put some people off because it\'s actually more than the PS5 console itself, but for the graphical power you\'re getting in that headset, it\'s more affordable than its PC equivalents.\"\r\n<p></p>\r\nLast month Sony denied reports that it had significantly reduced the sales projections for the headset because of a disappointing number of pre-orders. It was claimed that the company expected to sell 1.5 million devices by March 2024 rather than two million.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAs impressed as he is with the headset, Middler is worried that the same complaint which has dogged VR gaming from the beginning still applies now - what will people play? There\'s a lack of unique experiences available for the device he says.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"You\'re only really getting Horizon: Call of the Mountain as a true PS VR2 exclusive.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\"Where are all the other big Sony titles that make the PlayStation itself so popular?

(9, 'Julian Chokkatu', 'Review: Samsung Galaxy S23 and S23 Ultra', 'They’re not all that different from their predecessors, but they’re still some of the best phones you can buy.', '', 'I’m at a crossroads. Just a few weeks ago, I reviewed Samsung’s Galaxy A14 5G, calling it a phenomenal phone that costs a mere $200, proving that you really don’t need to pay heaving wads of dough to get a great smartphone. Now I’m reviewing Samsung\'s top-tier $1,200 Galaxy S23 Ultra and $800 Galaxy S23—and dang it, sometimes it’s nice to splurge, you know?\r\n<p></p>\r\nSamsung’s Galaxy S23 lineup (which also includes the S23+, a model I haven’t tested yet) are not game-changing devices in the least—and most people don’t need all these high-end cameras and tremendous horsepower. But I have to remind myself that sometimes it’s OK to pay up for the best of the best. It’s nice not having to squint at a dim screen on a sunny day, and to have the ability to play a demanding game at its highest fidelity.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIf you’re coming from a Galaxy S22 or S21 or any other flagship device released within the last two years, these new Samsung handsets don\'t really give you a reason to upgrade. But if you have something older in your pocket, or a more wallet-friendly device that you feel offers a compromised experience, then you should definitely take a look.I won’t bore you with the nitty-gritty specs on these phones. Instead, you can read my explainer on how the Galaxy S23, S23+, and S23 Ultra are all different and how they’re similar. (Heck, you can read last year\'s S22 series review to get the gist on what most of these new devices are about.) What you can\'t quite find out by reading specs are how these phones feel—the 6.1-inch S23 is my personal favorite because it fits my hands and most of the screen remains fairly accessible when I want to use it one-handed. The S23 Ultra\'s 6.8-inch display isn\'t terribly unwieldy, but while using it, I find my thumbs stretching farther and farther until my other hand has to join in—and I have large hands.\r\n\r\nThe best change is the S23 Ultra\'s edges, which are far flatter than last year\'s curvy S22 Ultra. The edges are not as flat as the edges on an iPhone 14, but the Ultra still feels nicer to hold than its predecessor, and my grip almost never interrupts the screen. Outside this, color me whelmed with how the Galaxy S23 lineup looks. I still think Samsung\'s S21 series offered a sharper design language with the Contour Cut camera module in an accent color. These new phones with their understated and accent-free camera array look like the textbook definition of a “smartphone”—they\'re no doubt elegant, but there\'s not much character.\r\n\r\nThe three handsets share many of the same traits, like how the 120-Hz AMOLED screens can each now hit 1,750 nits of peak brightness. This is a feature that\'s often overlooked; a high brightness makes it so much easier to read the screen when you\'re outside on a sunny day. Too often my fiancée has to squint at her Pixel phone, and that\'s never a problem here. (It also gets pretty darn dim for anyone who appreciates low brightness at bedtime.)\r\n<p></p>\r\nThey\'re all powered by Qualcomm\'s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 “for Galaxy” chipset, which is slightly faster than the base-level Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 you\'ll find on other flagship Android phones like the OnePlus 11. My benchmark tests bore that out, but it\'s not a massive leap. This chip is special in two ways. Year over year, it\'s really hard to notice meaningful gains in performance these days, but I\'ve noticed that phones with this processor feel more responsive and snappier than ever before. \r\n<p></p>\r\nSamsung Galaxy S23, S23+, and S23 Ultra\r\nSamsung Galaxy S23, S23+, and S23 Ultra\r\n<p></p>\r\nRATING: 9/10<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n$800 AT AMAZON (S23)\r\n$1,000 AT AMAZON (S23+)\r\n$1,200 AT AMAZON (S23 ULTRA)\r\n$800 AT SAMSUNG (ALL MODELS)\r\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Last year, I had to lower the graphics settings so the game would run without too many stutters. Now, the game feels super smooth at the highest graphics settings, and you only see a few stutters here and there after long play sessions, and only when there\'s a lot of action on the screen. The handset gets warm after some gaming, but not terribly so. Hooray!The second thing I like about this chip is its efficiency. Despite using the same 5,000-mAh cell as last year\'s S22 Ultra, Samsung claims the S23 Ultra lasts 20 percent longer. This rings true. The Ultra often lasted me well into a second day with average use, requiring a top-up around 3 pm. The S23 with its 3,900-mAh battery capacity comfortably lasted a full day with around 30 percent left in the tank by midnight. You probably don\'t need to tote a charger around everywhere you go. (Though if you need a charger, since Samsung doesn\'t include one in the box, we have recommendations in our guide to S23 cases and accessories.) \r\n<p></p>\r\nSamsung is leading the Android world with software updates, as these phones will get four Android OS upgrades and five years of monthly security updates. That\'ll make sure that you can keep using the S23 lineup as long as you\'d like without feeling as if you\'re missing out on new Android features (or crucial security fixes). Samsung\'s OneUI software interface isn\'t my absolute favorite, but it certainly beats the OnePlus 11, and I\'m so happy that a recent software update finally lets me disable Samsung Calendar, which I don\'t use, so I no longer have to get two notifications from it and Google Calendar.', 'Overall, I\'m really impressed and happy with the photos that come out of the S23 lineup. As with any camera system, there are some flaws, like how colors can be too saturated, or how the cameras try to smooth out your facial features by default. (You can turn this off.) I also don\'t get too much use out of the dedicated 200- or 50-megapixel camera modes on the S23 Ultra and S23, respectively. Sure, you can capture a lot of detail in these high-resolution photos, but I generally prefer the results from the default 12-megapixel shots (and they don\'t suck up as much storage). These cameras easily rival the Pixel 7 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro, and in many cases, they best them.', '2023-02-17', '09:00:00', 'US', '\\images\\Technology\\tech03.jpg', 1),

And much of the technology we use every day is built on the shoulders of the open-source community.\r\n<p></p>\r\nStill though, the open-source maintainers and architects of these code packages and libraries are often underappreciated.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“Anyone that works for passion,” said open source advocate Dr Colin Keogh, “their contributions can be undervalued.”\r\n\r\nBut that drive from the open-source community proved tremendously valuable during the Covid-19 pandemic. Keogh himself was an instigator of the Open Source Ventilator project, which sought to develop easy-to-assemble, low-cost ventilators using 3D printing.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAnd Waterford company NearForm’s Covid Green project helped deliver privacy-conscious Covid-19 contact-tracing software to regions around the world.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe need for rapid development in a time of crisis showcased the best of open source. But the concept is not always compatible with industry or critical projects because of its transparent, community-led nature.\r\n<p></p>\r\nKeogh hashed out the pros and cons of open source on the latest episode of For Tech’s Sake, a co-production from Silicon Republic and the HeadStuff Podcast Network.Though he himself is a fierce proponent of open source, he understands these incompatibilities.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“Anything community-sourced has this sort of chaotic nature to it,” he said. “It can be quite a burden for other people to come along, if you’re coming from industry. And it’s one of the issues that I think has held back the interaction and collaboration between industry and open source.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“You have open source: the pirates, the fixers, the makers, the non-structured approaches. And then industry, which is very logical and hierarchical and business-focused. And then they have to try and find a middle ground that neither of them are super comfortable with.”\r\n<p></p>\r\nThis “uncomfortable middle ground” is where Keogh sees the open-source movement going, and the community is working on the structures and frameworks to enable easier interaction with industry. However, he still concedes that some systems are not suitable to open source.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“If you’re running a software system or even a piece of hardware that has a critical function, you probably shouldn’t use open codebases for it if you think it will potentially have a risk down the line,” he said. “There are many cases where open source is not the answer.”\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe underlying risk of open source has been clearly demonstrated of late in the form of ‘protestware’, where maintainers and architects self-sabotage their codebases, which can impact millions of applications. Creators can also choose to simply abandon a project because, at the end of the day, they are unpaid volunteers. And with their departure goes a lot of tacit knowledge.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“In an awful lot of the cases you don’t actually know who the contributors are,” Keogh explained. “It might be an alias, it might be an online persona. You don’t know who they are in the real world so if you need to go and track them down, you can’t. You’re chasing a ghost of a name.”\r\n<p></p>\r\nWhen this happens, though, the community comes through.\r\n<p></p>\r\n“[It’s] an unfortunate by-product of open source and it relatively easily gets patched and improved upon iteration after iteration, because there’s always willing contributors to build the next generation.”\r\n<p></p>\r\nCheck out the full conversation with Keogh wherever you get your podcasts, and subscribe for more.', 'The underlying risk of open source has been clearly demonstrated of late in the form of ‘protestware’, where maintainers and architects self-sabotage their codebases, which can impact millions of applications.

However, only the first game is really a Batman-centric story. The other games in the series have put a much larger emphasis on the Justice League and have seemingly left the Batman mythos behind. It is nice to see other heroes get the spotlight, but the LEGO Batman series should be about The Dark Knight.LEGO Batman: The Videogame released in 2008, and it served as the first LEGO video game with an original story set within a pre-established IP.

(17, 'Adi Robertson', 'Resident Evil Village is a great PSVR 2 shooter, if you can stomach it', 'Sony’s new PlayStation VR2 is a solid headset with a relatively small launch catalog, and one of its most exciting titles is a VR mode for Resident Evil Village', '', ' Capcom’s first-person 2021 survival horror shooter. Village draws inspiration from Resident Evil 4, which got a stellar Meta Quest 2 port back in 2021, so I had high hopes. And they weren’t unfounded. The free PSVR 2 update to Village offers great shooting with the device’s Sense controllers and makes a solid case for the headset’s quirky “face rumble” feature. If only other parts didn’t torture me as badly as Ethan Winters’ hands.\r\n<p></p>\r\nI’m not making any claims to fully reviewing Village in VR here. In my free time since the mode’s launch on February 22nd, I’ve been spending halting hours working through most of its first two sections, comprised of Ethan exploring the eponymous village and the castle of noted vampire giantess Lady Dimitrescu. I’ve been reviewing VR games since 2016, and I consider myself to have an average tolerance for simulation sickness; I’ve spent long stretches playing motion-heavy games like Horizon Call of the Mountain in PSVR 2. But Village has demanded constant diligence to avoid triggering some of the worst nausea I’ve had in years, and I don’t trust myself to power through the whole thing in a timely fashion. I\'m not sure how many people will feel as bad as I did. My colleague Sean Hollister, for one, has had a better experience. Still, Village is a laundry list of risk factors for VR-induced illness. Like countless other VR games, you’re playing a pair of disembodied arms that can carry weapons or items, moving by default with the controller’s analog stick. But smooth stick-based motion can make plenty of VR users feel awful, and Village doesn’t have the teleportation-style fallback comfort mode that many titles — including Resident Evil 4 VR — offer. There’s a “tunneling” comfort option that narrows your field of view while you’re moving, but in my experience, it can only do so much.On top of that, levels are full of labyrinthine passages that require you to sprint away from enemies or backpedal while shooting. They force you to frequently turn either with the thumbstick, which nauseated both Sean and me, or your physical body, which quickly tangles you in the PSVR 2’s cord. The game is also full of long cutscenes that take control away from you, moving your virtual hands and head in ways that don’t reflect your real position.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThese elements directly, and maybe inevitably, reflect Village’s non-VR design. Resident Evil 4 VR feels great because its original level structure was relatively open and straightforward, built for methodical shooting gallery gameplay. (As an originally third-person game, it can also pull you out of first person for cutscenes and certain combat moves, rendering them in the game’s non-VR style.) By contrast, Village is a game where you’re often supposed to feel vulnerable and pressed for time, sometimes chased — or dragged — around in close quarters by things you can’t fight.But so far, that translates into periodic frustration even when I’m not sick. I’ve found myself running down twisted virtual staircases trying to avoid yanking the headset’s cable from my PlayStation 5 or selecting and turning in-game keys with a menu system just complicated enough to throw me into wasting precious seconds. Without venturing too far into spoiler territory, the interface asks you to use the right-hand face button to select key items... and during at least one scene, using your right hand for anything will feel incredibly wrong.\r\n<p></p>\r\nEspecially if you’re prone to motion sickness, I’m not convinced Village’s non-combat segments are worth the tradeoffs of VR. There are some delightful upsides: Lady D looks nicely imposing with the headset’s added illusion of physical presence, and if you weren’t already wincing at Ethan’s nonstop limb trauma, raising the Sense controllers to examine his half-healed wounds up close will probably do the trick. But the locomotion and item handling is just clumsy enough that it’s almost as distracting as it is immersive. That’s particularly true when you’re backtracking to solve Village’s puzzles since VR mode simplifies the map in a way that (as far as I can tell) limits it to your immediate vicinity rather than letting you pan or flip between floors.\r\n<p></p>\r\nWhich is a shame because, the moment you stop moving and pull out a gun, VR simply feels like the way Village is meant to be played. The game’s shooting is similar to Resident Evil 4 VR: you’ve got an array of weapons attached to your body, and you mime pulling them off your hip or back to draw them, then reload by grabbing ammunition from a pouch at your side. It makes for a faster pace than gamepad-based combat, and moving your arm to aim a gun (or raising your hands to block an attack) feels a lot more natural than pushing around an analog stick. I’ve got some quibbles, like the fact that it’s easy to reach a little too far back and grab the map off your back instead of ammo. But it’s fun, mostly intuitive, and incredibly satisfying, down to the face vibration that hits every time a real-world shotgun or rifle butt would kick against your cheek or shoulder.', 'Village isn’t quite the easy PSVR 2 win I’d hoped for, and as long as Sony sticks with a cabled headset, I’m not sure there is an easy win to be had. But at the very least, it delivers on the promise of its action elements — and for a lot of people, that might be enough.', '2023-02-27', '04:30:00', 'Canada', '\\images\\Gaming\\gaming05.png', 2),
(18, 'Martin Filipov', 'New iPhone 15 Pro looks more boring than a PowerPoint', 'The iPhone has always been a standard for design with meticulous attention to detail, as well as exceptional build quality.', '', 'Whether it’s the iconic original iPhone (notable for being… the first iPhone), the iPhone 4 (perhaps the most universally beloved iPhone design), the super-slim and durable iPhone 5 (heavy metal!), or probably the most comfortable iPhones to hold - iPhone 6, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and iPhone X, Cupertino has had some serious hits throughout the years. Of course, the Apple logo also helps to make the designs stand out...                                                   But that was years ago! Today, it so happens that there’s not much you can do or change with modern slab phones to make them look totally unique. Almost all of them are glass sandwiches held together by a metal frame and a ton of glue. Yet, it’s not like other (read: Android) phone-makers haven’t found ways to spice things up, making some head-turning smartphones. I won’t manage to name all of them, but here are a few blasts from the recent past:\r\n<p></p>\r\nOnePlus 7 Pro (thanks to the pop-up selfie camera that made this phone’s display one best-looking ones ever)\r\n<p></p>\r\nHuawei P20 Pro, P30 Pro, P40 Pro (Eye-catching colors on the P20, P30 series, ceramic glass back on the P40 Pro, including the first “overflow screen” which made it look like you’re holding a bezel-less phone)\r\n<p></p>\r\nGalaxy S21 Ultra (this one looked like it meant business; aggressive and not for everyone, but a definite statement from Samsung’s design team)\r\n<p></p>\r\nXiaomi Mi 11 Ultra (potentially one of the only Android phones that manages to outbadass than the S21 Ultra, the Mi 11 Ultra had an actual display next to its already huge camera housing)\r\n<p></p>\r\nXiaomi Mix 4 (one of the first phones with an under-display camera, and probably the one that hides it best)\r\n<p></p>\r\nPixel 6 and 6 Pro (the Sorta Sunny Pixel 6 Pro remains my favorite smartphone design of all time - the camera bar is unmistakable)And that brings us to the present day and the freshly-leaked iPhone 15 Pro, which according to recent CAD-based renders, might not look as “new” as the some rumors suggested. Speaking of which, It’s probably a good idea to establish what’s considered a “new design”?\r\n<p></p>\r\nTo some people that’d be an updated look, which still has something new to it - hence it’s a \"new design\". To others (like me) new means new - not a tune-up, but an upgrade/redesign. So, no - I don’t really consider the iPhone 15 Pro’s slightly rounded edges and thinner bezels “new design”, as I believe it’d be difficult for a regular person to tell the iPhone 15 Pro apart from the iPhone 14 Pro. Just me?\r\n<p></p>\r\nSo, what I’m saying is - there are certain ways to make slab phones look more recognizable and give them a little bit of a personality. But as per usual, Apple’s playing by its own rules here. Sure, there’s no other iPhone (like there are dozens of Android phone-makers), and if you want an iPhone, you’ll have to settle for the one and only option that Tim Cook & Co send your way, but that only makes what’s considered a phone without much personality (due to how ubiquitous iPhones are) even less exciting (I\'m trying hard not to say \"boring\").I believe “personality” is a key word here, as this might be the single thing that’s been known to set Android phones and iPhones apart for ages. From Android\'s rich software customization options (although iOS has been catching up recently) to the massive design choice out there, Android-powered phones have always been for those who want to be a little bit “different”, and less “basic”. Funny enough, Apple is the one that’s supposed to “Think Different”.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHere are some of the most attractive-looking Android phons of 2022-2023 that have caught my eye (in that order):\r\n<p></p>\r\nXiaomi 12S Ultra (I like it in green; the black is sleek too)\r\nNothing Phone 1 (I like this one in black, but the white version is just as good-looking)\r\nGoogle Pixel 7 Pro (I prefer the white one)', 'By the way, Apple, if you need inspiration, there are some exceptionally talented people on the internet who will design the 2024 iPhone 16 for free (if you stole their ideas). You can see some of them above, Tim. I know you\'re reading. Give me credits; cut me in on the deal; a board seat maybe?!', '2023-01-01', '12:00:00', 'US', '\\images\\Reviews\\review01.png', 4),

The latest OnePlus 11 is a very good phone for a $699 asking price, and it launched together with the new $179.99 OnePlus Buds Pro 2.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThat\'s no small amount of money for wireless earphones — sure, it\'s cheaper than the Apple AirPods Pro 2 or Samsung\'s Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, but more expensive than the regular Galaxy Buds 2 or even OnePlus\' own other offers — the Buds Z2 and Nord Buds.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAll of the aforementioned models have excellent sound, but here\'s what sets the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 apart:\r\n<p></p>\r\nOnePlus Buds Pro 2 in a nutshell:\r\nDual drivers - 11 mm and 6 mm - tuned by Dynaudio\r\nAndroid Spatial Audio support\r\nCustomizable sound — EQ and automatic Audio ID 2.0\r\nUp to -48 dB noise reduction\r\nThe design here is the same as the OnePlus Buds Pro from 2021, but that\'s very much OK. They are rounded and soft with relatively short microphone stems, and provide a good fit and seal when in use. My ears are typically quite picky with earbuds and their comfort. With the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, I could feel some discomfort after an hour\'s use, with wearing fatigue coming in about 2:30 to 3 hours of non-stop use. By my standards — this is pretty acceptable, I would continue using them daily and recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortably-fitting set to try.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAs usual, there are three tip sizes inside the box to customize your fit, and their proprietary app will test if you have a proper seal when the Buds Pro 2 are in, which is nice.\r\nOut of the box, without downloading their HeyMelody app, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 already sound fantastic. The bass is very deep and thumpy, but incredibly focused and controlled. At no point did we feel any head-squeezing sensation, or loss of detail in the music. The upper midrange seems to have a confidently pronounced hump, but it somehow doesn\'t sound harsh or fatiguing — just very detailed. There\'s a lot of air room in the highs as well, without causing hiss or the feeling of compression.\r\n<p></p>\r\nWe tried comparing them with their closest competitors — the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2 — and we can\'t quite liken them to each. Every one of these buds has their own way of \"sounding good\" — in the OnePlus Buds Pro 2\'s case, the signature sound comes from the detailed upper midrange and the super-focused bass response.', 'All in all, these are pretty solid earbuds, but they are also not exactly cheap. The first generation of the OnePlus Buds Pro had an MSRP of $149.99, these new ones are up to $179.99. You could chalk that up to inflation, but let\'s not forget that we also got upgraded to dual drivers within the earbud and Spatial Audio support.', '2023-01-04', '06:53:00', 'US', '\\images\\Reviews\\review02.png', 4),
(20, 'Mariyan Slavov', 'Huawei Watch Buds review: \"The name\'s Bond, James Bond!\"', 'We all love gadgets. This is the reason you\'re reading this and also the reason I\'m writing it.', '', 'It absolutely can not shoot lasers or cut through anything, but when I first popped the lid open to get the tiny buds out, I immediately got that childish Bond-awe feeling. And this is the most important thing, right?\r\n<p></p>\r\nIs the Huawei Watch Buds a perfect device? Hell, no! But it\'s the best iteration of a very neat idea, and possibly a trend-setter. But enough chitchat. Let\'s dive in!\r\n<p></p>\r\nJump to section:<p></p>\r\nThe idea\r\nWhat\'s inside the box\r\nThe watch\r\nDesign\r\nSoftware and features\r\nFitness and sleep tracking\r\nThe buds\r\nDesign and specs\r\nSound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life\r\nThe experience/Final verdict\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe idea\r\n<p></p>\r\nFor those of you who are not familiar with the Huawei Watch Buds, in a nutshell, Huawei decided to integrate a pair of earbuds inside a smartwatch. Hence the name, which, while not particularly original (I would have called it the SuperAgent Watch or something similar), is a fairly accurate description.\r\n<p></p>\r\nWhat\'s inside the box?\r\n<p></p>\r\nInside the retail box, you\'ll find the watch, a magnetic charger, some leaflets, and a quick user guide (with pictures!), alongside two additional silicone tips for the buds. I wouldn\'t call the box lavish, but it features the most important things to get you started. An additional sporty or stainless steel strap would\'ve been nice, though, especially at this price point.The Watch\r\nDesign\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe design of the Huawei Watch Buds bears some resemblance to the Watch GT lineup, with the lid being the most obvious exception. The chassis is stainless steel with a ceramic back, and our test unit came with a brown/beige 22mm leather quick-release strap.\r\n<p></p>\r\nA single button on the right side serves as a home/back navigation button, and there\'s a long, textured push-in button on the side facing the user, which releases the lid lock and pops it slightly open. You need to press it inward toward the watch (not down), and it requires a healthy amount of force, preventing it from opening up by accident.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe face of the watch, housing the 1.43-inch, 466 x 466 AMOLED display, is curved on the sides and also features a hefty bezel. It somehow reminded me of the Google Pixel Watch. When you open the lid, both bullet-like buds pop out with it, magnetically attached inside tiny indentations. The two holes housing the buds remain empty, showing the charging pins and the Huawei logo between them.\r\nIt\'s a practical design; taking out the buds is much easier this way; you don\'t have to pry them from the deeper beds to get them out. Also, there\'s no left and right bud (the two automatically switch depending on how you place them inside your ears), and even though there are R and L letters printed, you can put either of the buds in either hole; the only requirement is that they face downward (with the eartip).A clever part is the charging rings that are platinum-plated and run around the buds. Effectively, you can place them on any side, and the rings will make contact with the charging pins. Very convenient. These rings are platinum for a reason: they\'re corrosion resistant, which is well-thought-out for a gadget that will be exposed to salt water, a.k.a. sweat.\r\n<p></p>\r\nJust a side note, the buds are rated as IP54, which is pretty decent, you shouldn\'t worry about taking these to the gym or jogging outside in a light drizzle, as the British would say.\r\n<p></p>\r\nHuawei took everything they\'ve R&D-ed over the years and put it inside these little buds. They feature a planar diaphragm (normally reserved for audiophile-grade headphones), a quad-magnet setup, a 20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response, active noise cancellation with dual microphones, wear detection, and touch controls on top of everything else.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAs already mentioned above, the buds feature something called \"right-left auto discovery,\" which means you can practically put them in without thinking which one is left and which is right. Another cool thing is that these are automatically paired with the watch, so you don\'t need to do anything to use them right out of the box... I mean, out of the watch!A clever part is the charging rings that are platinum-plated and run around the buds.

It offers bigger, more usable displays - both internal and cover panels - than the narrower Z Flip 4 without being harder to use with one hand when unfurled.A standout design is the recipe for a phone line\'s success, and Oppo has delivered by fitting a huge for clamshell standards 3.26-inch external screen that is on top of that with portrait orientation, taking as much of the rear half as engineeringly possible. This has allowed Oppo to show much more information there compared to the puny outer panels on the Z Flip 4 or the Moto Razr, its only two peers. Just one look at the external screen widget system below, and it immediately becomes clear that the display is not just there to take the time and preview notifications.Oppo has anointed the Find N2 with other design features that make it the most ergonomic and usable as a daily driver clamshell out there. First off, it is as wide as a normal bar phone, meaning that when you flip open the 6.8-inch internal display its viewing area is much larger than what the tall and narrow display of the Z Flip 4 offers without going to the ultrawide extremes of the Razr. <p></p>\r\nOn top it all off, Oppo managed to craft the Find N2 Flip as a thinner foldable phone when closed, which is a real achievement considering the much larger 4300 mAh battery inside. A lot of modern clamshell phone owners are choosing them because they fit in shallow jeans pockets and every little bit helps when it comes to thickness. Despite all these sweet additions, the Find N2 Flip is only slightly taller than the Z Flip 4, too, extending its ergonomics prowess further.A new Flexion hinge\r\n5 years in the making, the new Flexion can open for a decade!\r\n<p></p>\r\nOppo gradually began beating Samsung at its own foldable phone display game by offering devices with barely visible crease in the middle where they bend, all thanks to the ingenious Flexion hinge design that uses a combination of aeronautical high-strength steel at the key bearing position together with aircraft carbon-fiber reinforced polymer to ensure a strong but compact and light hinge. The new spindle assembly provides a smooth range of motion and the ability to hold position at any of its stages \"between 45º and 110º.\"', 'To wit, the Find N2 Flip is being launched globally at a very aggressive price tag, even though it delivers better photos than the Z Flip 4, has faster charging, way bigger main display with ironed-out crease, and a cover screen fit for a cover girl.\r\n', '2023-03-03', '10:00:00', 'Canada', '\\images\\Reviews\\review04.png', 4),

(23, 'Cameron Faulkner', 'The best Nintendo Switch controllers to buy right now', 'From the unbeatable Switch Pro and comfy Joy-Con alternatives to a dongle that lets you use your Xbox or PlayStation controllers with your Switch, these are the best Switch controllers you can get', '', 'The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it. The removable Joy-Cons included with all Switch consoles (except for the Switch Lite) are convenient since they can be detached to use as wireless controllers for two people. But their tiny contourless design isn’t that comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. (And don’t get me started on the dreaded Joy-Con drift.)\r\n<p></p>\r\nThankfully, you have plenty of alternatives, though only some of them are worth your money. In this buying guide, I focus on wireless controllers that are comfortable and reliable as well as a few with unique features that enhance your play, like input customization and long battery life. I’m not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same. (PowerA and PDP make decent ones that I can personally vouch for, but unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)\r\n\r\nIf you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in: not one made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:\r\n<p></p>\r\nIt won’t have HD rumble (this is what Nintendo calls its haptics, which are precise and akin to Sony’s DualSense in their subtlety), though some more limited rumble may be present. <p></p>\r\nIt may not have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it or an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figures that unlock special features in some games. \r\nIt also won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.) \r\nAlso, while some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.Nintendo Switch Pro Controller↴<p></p>\r\nThe best Switch controller for TV mode\r\nNintendo’s own Pro controller is still the best one out there. It launched alongside the Switch in 2017, and it’s my favorite on any console. Aside from the Joy-Cons, it’s the only wireless Switch controller that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines. It’s also the only controller I’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it.\r\n<p></p>\r\nBeyond those qualities, the Pro controller has comfort and build quality rivaling the flagship console controllers of Microsoft and Sony. It’s built like a tank, and it has battery life so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. Just like the Switch itself, the controller charges over USB-C. And it’s compatible with a slew of other devices you might game on, including PCs, Android devices, and Apple devices including Mac computers running macOS Ventura, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and Apple TV.  \r\n<p></p>\r\nGiven the price, I wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, though wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller doesn’t seem possible. But at least you can connect headphones via Bluetooth if you have no more than two controllers connected to your Switch at once.GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro↴\r\nThe best Xbox-style controller for Switch\r\nThe GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro rivals the Switch Pro Controller in build quality, but it feels more like a modern Xbox controller, and its textured rear grips might give it the edge for some. Unlike most third-party controllers, it retains Amiibo support, though its rumble is not great-feeling. The KingKong 2 Pro can connect via Bluetooth to the Switch and to PC, macOS, iOS, Android, and other platforms. And because it uses GuliKit’s Hall effect sensors for its analog sticks, it’s immune to drift.\r\n<p></p>\r\nI recommend checking out this video at iFixit to see a thorough explanation of how it works, but in essence, Hall effect sensors use magnets to alter electrical current instead of physically rubbing on (and eventually wearing down) a sensor to produce an input. While I haven’t had a problem with analog stick drift on the Switch Pro (yet), controllers with Hall effect sensors will never encounter it. (The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, below, also uses GuliKit’s sensors.)\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nGuliKit KingKong 2 Pro<p></p>\r\n$70\r\nIf you’re looking for a Switch controller that’s also a great Bluetooth controller for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android, GuliKit’s KingKong 2 Pro is a worthwhile purchase. It has Hall effect sticks that ensure that its analog sticks won’t suffer from drift, Amiibo support, and it feels like an Xbox controller in the hand.\r\n<p></p>\r\n$70 AT AMAZON<p></p>\r\nTop-down shot of 8BitDo Ultimate Controller on an orange and yellow background. The controller has an asymmetric joystick design, like an Xbox or Switch Pro controller, and it’s black, with white legends on the A B X Y buttons.\r\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller works with the Switch as well as Windows PCs, Android, and iOS devices, and it comes with a 2.4GHz dongle, too.\r\n8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller↴\r\nA Switch controller for Steam Deck and PC\r\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller, and it supports both Windows PCs and the Steam Deck. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, but it adds back paddles that can be customized with its companion software. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but I recommend the Bluetooth one over the 2.4GHz or wired options because the Bluetooth version includes 2.4GHz as well and because it has GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller<p></p>\r\n$70\r\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller comes with its own charging dock, features remappable controls, and is compatible with the Steam Deck and Windows PCs thanks to its Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity.

The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like Breath of the Wild, Fortnite, and Splatoon 3 that allow gyroscopic aiming.\r\n<p></p>\r\nWith 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and Mac modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for $50 (or $59.99 if you want the incredibly cool translucent purple version).\r\n<p></p>\r\nPlayStation gamers may appreciate that the Pro 2’s left analog stick is toward the bottom, just like on Sony’s controllers, rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro and Xbox controllers.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n8BitDo Pro 2<p></p>\r\n$50\r\nThe 8BitDo Pro 2 offers many of the same features as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller but at a lower price point and with a DualShock-style layout. It features extra triggers, hand grips, remappable buttons, and back paddles and can pair with Windows, macOS, Steam Deck, and mobile devices via Bluetooth.\r\n<p></p>\r\n$50 AT AMAZON\r\n$50 AT BEST BUY\r\nA Nintendo Switch tablet sitting inside of its dock. Next to it is Sony’s DualShock 4 controller, which can be used with the Switch by way of the 8BitDo USB Adapter.\r\nThe 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 can connect to a range of current and older Bluetooth wireless controllers, including the DualShock 4 shown here.\r\n8BitDo USB Adapter 2↴\r\nUse your own controller\r\nThere aren’t many other devices in this category, but this one is the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, use this $19.99 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 transmitter to turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports controllers from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers all the way back to Wii and PS3 controllers. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)\r\n<p></p>\r\nTo my surprise, when I paired the adapter with a DualSense controller from my PS5, I didn’t just get a control experience that felt like the Switch Pro — I also experienced better than average rumble and responsive motion controls. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series S or X controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app software. \r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n8BitDo USB Adapter 2<p></p>\r\n$20\r\n8Bitdo’s USB Adapter 2 looks like a flash drive, but when connected to your Switch’s dock, it enables you to wirelessly pair one of a number of older PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers to it.\r\n<p></p>\r\n$20 AT AMAZON\r\n$20 AT BEST BUY\r\n8BitDo has an extensive support page listing the steps required to set up your specific controller as well as which features of those controllers it supports. If you plan to use a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\r\n<p></p>\r\nIf you already have controllers around and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to get them connected, this affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you want to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each of them (plus a USB hub to give yourself enough ports), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\r\n<p></p>\r\nRelated\r\nHere are some must-have accessories for your Nintendo Switch\r\nHori’s Split Pad Pro are connected to a Nintendo Switch that is displaying Super Mario Sunshine.\r\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in several different colors (each one usually sells at a different price). Unlike the Joy-Cons, they don’t have rechargeable batteries, rumble, or motion control support.\r\nHori Split Pad Pro↴\r\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\r\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Cons, but kids and small-handed folks aside, I haven’t met many who praise them for their comfort. I have met more than a few people who play in handheld mode and want controls that better fit larger hands and feel more like a regular console controller. The solution is the Hori Split Pad Pro, a $50 (or sometimes cheaper) pair of Joy-Con replacements.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Joy-Cons, it has big easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who either need to really get a good handle on the console for fast gameplay or just to stay comfy for longer play sessions.', 'The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors, so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. I don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller.', '2023-02-24', '09:02:00', 'US', '\\images\\Reviews\\review06.png', 4);
